# Birthday Bot - Privacy Policy

This Birthday Role Discord Bot, made by TwilightZebby for use in Dr1fterX's Discord Server, will **not** collect or store any data beyond what is required for the operation and functionality of the Bot.

For full transparency, the type of data the Bot uses and/or stores is listed below:

- Discord User ID - used for identifying who to grant the Birthday Role to
- User's Birth Month and Date (**not** Birth Year) - used for knowing *when* to give the User in question the Birthday Role

Furthermore, this data is only given to the Bot when explicitly given by the User through the use of the `/birthday set` command. The Birth Month and Date are stored and processed as Integers (for example, "December" becomes 11, "January" becomes 0, etc).

The data stored for a User (as listed above) is deleted should one of two conditions occur:

- Either the User in question runs the `/birthday remove` command, explicitly telling the Bot to delete their data,
- OR the User leaves Dr1fterX's Discord Server, in which the Bot will remove their data, should they have any stored.

Additionally, the Birthday Bot's source code is open-sourced, should one wish to see for themselves how and when data is handled by the Bot.
